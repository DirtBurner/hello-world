# hello-world
Initial repository

I am constructing this repository to learn about Github. My goals include:

* Initiating version control for functions and scripts for my lab group
* Instituting a way to share operable Jupyter notebook SOPs to new students and visiting students
* Sharing scripts, functions, and models with users outside of my laboratory group
